**_Veggie Foodie_ does not upload, store, use or share any of your data.**
The application _Veggie Foodie_ neither collects any data nor implies any data collection by third parties or intermediaries. Any data you provide during the usage of _Veggie Foodie_ (including photos, location or any other information) will be strictly stored in the internal storage of your device. The data stored in internal device storage are containerized, i. e. stored with access restricted to this application, and cannot be accessed by other apps installed on the device. When _Veggie Foodie_ is uninstalled, all the app-related data are removed.

_Veggie Foodie_ uses some device's functionalities, including camera, photo gallery, location and storage. When the app needs to access each of these functionalities for the first time, a pop-up will be displayed and you can or cannot explicitly grant permission for the functionality. Moreover, you can enable or disable access to this information at any time, through your device settings.

_Veggie Foodie_ also allows to login using your Google account. This login is completely **optional** and does not restrict the usage of any app functionality. _Veggie Foodie_ only uses the name and avatar you use for your Google account, and these data are exclusively used to be displayed in the app, as a welcome message on the Home screen. This information is also stored in the internal storage, to avoid user login every time the app is launched. The information is removed when you logout from Google account or uninstall the app.

This Privacy Policy might be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

We will let You know via email and/or a notification on the application, prior to the change becoming effective and update the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.
You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
